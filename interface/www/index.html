                Git is a program you have to run on your computer. The installation steps depend on your operating system.

                <ul class="mui-tabs__bar mui-tabs__bar--justified">
                    <li class="mui--is-active">

                    <p>
                        First, let's check if git is already installed. Open the command-promt (press start and type <em>cmd</em>) or git bash (press start and type <em>git bash</em>).
                        Then type the following and press enter.
                        <code>git --version</code>
                        If you get something similar to <em>git version 2.19.0</em> it is installed!
                        Read on how to configure your name further down.
                    <p>

                    <h3>Installing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Download git <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">here</a> and run the installer.
                        Try the above mentioned test to see if the install was sucsessfull.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Creating a user</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now with git installed we need to make certain git knows who we are, see if it already does by typing
                        <code>git config user.name</code>
                        If it responds with a name you've got everything set up.
                        Otherwise type<br>
                        <code>git config --global user.name "Your Name"</code><br>
                        <code>git config --global user.email "your@email.com"</code><br>

                    There are a lot of powerfull graphical git tools, we're not going to talk about them in this workshop but if you don't appreciate the command line interface you can have a look at <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken</a>. A simpler, but often sufficient, tool is <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a>.

                Let's <em>pull</em> ourselves together and try what we've lerned. Get a practice repo by selecting a challange and typing a username. This is to make sure you won't accidentally work on someone else's project.

                    <br>
                    Sometimes you'll be asked for credentials, they are the following

                    Username: <u id="the-username"></u>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        As we saw in the pressentation <em>pushing</em> can sometimes cause errors if someone else has commited. Usually we try to run <code>git pull</code> before <code>git push</code> to avoid these simple errors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Try repeating the introduction excersise but <em>pulling</em> before you do a <em>push</em>. If you forgot something the presentation is <a href="/pressentation/">here</a>.

                        GitHub is a website were git repositories can be stored, just as here on <a href="/">git.dhack.se</a>. It is the largest service of it's kind, but in no way affiliated with git the software.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However since the tools hosted by GitHub are very usefull we recommend creating an account for yourself there. GitHub also has a free student license. To create your account go to <a href="https://github.com/join">github.com/join</a> to and sign up with your chalmers email. When you have an account the student plan is enabled by visiting <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">education.github.com/pack</a> and klicking "Get your pack" and follow the instructions on the page.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="co-gh">
                    <p>
                        This excercise is meant for two or more people to co-operate, find yourself a partner and follow the instructions. Also make sure you have created a GitHub account, if you haven't the excercise "GitHub Account" has instructions on how yo do that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now we're gonna try to co-operate as if we had been working on lab together. The instructions will not be very specific and you are more free to do what you like, but if you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask questions!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To make things easier we recommend one of you host the project on their GitHub. Decide whom of you it will be. That person will have to <a href="https://github.com/new">create a new repository</a> on GitHub. Tick the "Initialize this repository with a README" checkbox to make <em>cloning</em> the <em>repository</em> a little bit easier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, to allow others to push to your repository, go to project-settings by pressing the tab "Settings" with a little gear icon. Then go to Collaborators and add the others.
                        They will get a notification on GitHub and an email with an invite link.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now all of you <em>clone</em> the project and play around a bit. Try pushing and pulling as much as you can. Can you identify when you get a conflict and when you don't?
                    </p>

                <p>
                    Git is a powerful tool for version control and cooperative coding. But to many it seems very complicated and hard to wrap your head around. This leads people to avoid using it properly and in turn gives them even more trouble.
